# Concepts

I am a **software developer/administrator/DevOps engineer** and on this page I am collecting concepts of projects I have worked on. The idea is to show cost efficient solutions to common problems that occur when running a business. For example creating backups of servers to restore their functionality in case of an error.

Links to the used software products are provided.

* [Backup concept for small business with 1 to 5 servers](backup/README.md)
* [Improve code quality in Eclipse](codequality/README.md)
* [Publishing of artifacts to remote maven repository](artifactpublish/README.md)
